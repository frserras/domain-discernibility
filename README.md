## Abstract
In this study, we explore the computational discernibility of Portuguese language discourse domains using a balanced sample from the Carolina corpus,
including its five largest domains: *Juridical*, *Entertainment*, *Journalistic*, *Virtual* and *Instructional*. We analyze discernibility across three levels:
degree of duplication, linguistic features distribution, and separability within semantic embedding spaces.
We found clear quantitative differences between domains at all levels, compatible with expected qualitative properties.
Our analysis shows that these domains can be distinguished based on various computable text properties,
and suggests a consistent complexity scale between them. We identify the distinguishing properties and their potential benefits for NLP tasks.
Additionally, we provide domain-balanced and deduplicated versions of Carolina for future research.
